# Quantum computer laboratory assignments which were done in Intro to Quantum computing Vilnius university 2023.

The tasks with their solutions are in 
  - QuantumLab1
  - QuantumLab2
  - Quantum team project
    For the team project my contribution to the team project was Shor's algorithm using pennylane library on python.


The book from which I learned the quantum computing basics:

- Mannucci, Mirco A._Yanofsky, Noson S - Quantum computing for computer scientists
